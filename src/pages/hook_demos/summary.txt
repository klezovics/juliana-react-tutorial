Summary:
- Hook contain business logic and are the "brain" of the component
- Hook are functions
- Everything is based on react hooks
- Then you also have hook libraries
- You can combine base react hooks with hook libraries to create your own custom hooks
- Each hook provides some data values(reactive!!) and some functions

How to get better at using hooks:
- Practice using react hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef and maybe others
- Look into 3 different hook libraries and try to using them
- Try to create your own custom hooks
- Try to write tests which test your hooks
